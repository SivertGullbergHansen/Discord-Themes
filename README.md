### Description

This theme was based off the colors showcased on the official Discord homepage. 

In the previews, we can see that the roles colours are not coloring the user but instead the role-title. Sadly, we cannot achieve this unless I write a custom plugin that reverses the colours (make your username appear in the default white colour and your role-title appear in its selected colour).

Another sad thing is that in the previews on discords website, you can also see below the users picture in the enlarged user-panel, the roles have a border with a fill-background. It is the same case here, where we cannot set the colour of the background to be equal to the role-colour unless we write a custom plugin.
